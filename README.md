Coursework for TESU COS-1110 Intro to Programming

## Module 1 - Programming Assigment 1

- MO1.1 ```RanNumGen.java```
  Generates user-specified number of random numbers between 1 and 100 (both inclusive), printing each as they are generated, and then reports the minimum and maximum random numbers generated.
- MO1.2 ```AndOp.java```
  Tests whether two supplied numbers are &gt; 0.0 and &lt; 1.0, and prints true or false.
- MO1.2 ```LC.java```
  Uses for-loop and if statement to print integers 1-100, with 10 integers per line.

## Module 2 - Programming Assignment 2

- M02.1 ```RelativelyPrimeArray.java```
  Takes an integer, *n* as a command line parameter, creates an •n•x•n* of type boolean such that each element is true or false based on whether
  the element's indices are relatively prime, and then outputs the results
  to the screen
- M02.2 ```Distribution100```
  Accepts integer command-line arguments each between 1 and 100. The first of which denotes how many others will follow. 
  It then calculates how many of those are greater than 50 and how many are less than or equal to 50, and outputs the results.
- M02.3 ```Average```
  Collects multiple lines of data, a name and three integers each. 
  To set this up, it accepts a single command-line parameter indicating how many lines of data will be input by the user.
  From then on, so long as the user types a name followed by three integers, the program will accept them.
  Program completes when user enters a blank line after inputting the specified number of rows.
  For each row, the three integers are averaged, and then the results are displayed
  in tabular from.
